# Publication Bias Webinar (Monday, 18 August 2019, 13.00 AEST/10.00 WIB)

## Aims
This webinar aims to familiarise Indonesian researchers with publication bias and meta-research. Systematic review and meta-analysis is rarely seen in Indonesian scientific discourse, while it might offer a better evidence and insight than a single study. By organising this webinar, we hope to cover some introductory questions related to publication bias which are including:

* Why does single empirical study offer very limited insights?
* What is publication bias?
* Why does is matter?
* How could it happen?
* ..and why researchers should solve this problem together?

The main idea of this webinar is spreading 'a sense' that science is in crisis and therefore reformation is desperately needed. We will amplify this 'sense of crisis' by organising a follow-up webinar in September (Replication Crisis by Lysander James) and 'resolve the tension' by organising another (and larger) webinar in October (Advancing Science by Practicing Open Scientific Practice - in collaboration with Center for Open Science).


## Potential participants' profiles
Per 13 August (15:03 WIB), we have 49 potential participants who have signed up to join the webinar. Participants are mostly researchers/full-time lecturers, working at various universities in Indonesia. Participants are concentrated in Java (the most populous island), but we're currently working to expand the coverage to the outer islands.

Most participants (59.2%) admitted that they never conduct meta-research, but have heard about it and might be doing it in the future. Additionaly, 30.6% never heard about meta-research, but are very interested in learning more. A small fraction of participants (8.2%) said they had conducted meta-analysis before.


## How we do the webinar
We're going to use Zoom's conference call (not webinar feature), so the room is limited only to 100 participants. Amelia will send invitation to all participants and the presenter (Dr Mathew Ling). Webinar format is not something that everyone is familiar to, so moderators (Amelia and Ilham) will work together to help solving technical glitches and to break language barrier.
